# node-textfromkey

Couldn't find a good app for this compatible universally (it's a little known fact that I have to suffer with the inhibitions of MacOS). It was initially made for quieter typing, but could probably be bound for a lot more uses.

## setup and usage

Pretty straightforward, just `cd` into the directory, run `npm install` (requires node)

to start the app, just run `node index.js`

## binding keys

you'll have to do this manually for now, although I'll probably add a way to bind keys through the console sometime in the near future. wasn't originally planning to post this on github, so didn't think I'd need to make anything like this
